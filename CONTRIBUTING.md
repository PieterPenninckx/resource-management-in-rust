Contributing
============

We welcome contributions, big and small.
'Resource management in Rust' is in an early stage, so it can be a little
chaotic.

Reporting issues
----------------

Certainly open an issue when you think there is something wrong.

You can also open an issue if something is unclear. 
There's currently no streamlined process for that, just open an issue and we
will see what we do with that.

Improving the text
------------------

Some parts of the text are more mature than others. This determines
how you can contribute to that part. If you want to make a small contribution,
just open a pull request. If you want to do something bigger, like adding a 
chapter or rewriting a whole chapter or re-structuring the text, it is a good
idea to first open an issue. In this way, we can avoid having two people working
on the same and we can check if it is something we are likely to accept.

You can open your pull request against the master branch.


### Some tips

If you feel more comfortable with talking that with writing, you can make
an audio recording of yourself and then make a transcription of that.

Don't worry if you don't use fancy words. It is better to be clear than
to be poetic. Also, the text is also intended for people who speak English
as a second or even third language and we want the text to be accessible to
them.

You don't need to impress with your knowledge. We assume no prior knowledge of
systems programming, so It is better to explain too much than too title.

Happy writing!


More questions?
---------------

If it is unclear how you can contribute, just open an issue for that and ask
your question.
